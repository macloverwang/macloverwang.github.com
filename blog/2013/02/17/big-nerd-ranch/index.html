<h4>Chapter 1 summary:</h4>


<br>


<p>When an iOS application starts, it puts a view on the screen. You can think of this view as the
background on which everything else appears: buttons, labels, etc. Buttons and labels are also views. In
fact, anything that can appear to the user is a view.<br>
The iOS SDK is an object-oriented library, and views are represented by objects. Each view is an
instance of one of several subclasses of the UIView class. For example, a button is an instance of
UIButton, which is a subclass of UIView.<br>
you create and configure view objects and then save them into an archive. The archive is a XIB
(pronounced “zib”)file.<br>
A XIB file is an XML representation of the archived objects. When you build a project, the XIB file is
compiled into a NIB file. Developers work with XIB files (they’re easier to edit), and applications use
NIB files (they’re smaller and easier to parse). However, most iOS developers use the words XIB and
NIB interchangeably.<br>
When you build an application, the compiled NIB file is copied into the application’s bundle. The
bundle is a directory containing the application’s executable and any resources the executable uses.
When your application reads in, or loads, the NIB file from the bundle at runtime, the objects in the
archive are brought to life. Simple application will have only one NIB file, and it will be loaded
when the application first launches. A complex application, however, can have many NIB files that are
loaded as they are needed.<br></p>

<h4>File&#8217;s Owner</h4>


<br>


<p>This is the object that will have access to the objects archived in the XIB file.
It will be an instance of YouNameItViewController, which is the object responsible
for managing events that occur on this interface.<br></p>

<h4>First Responder</h4>


<br>


<p>This object doesn’t have much use in iOS right now; it is a relic from Desktop
Cocoa. You can ignore it.<br></p>

<h4>View</h4>


<br>


<p>An instance of UIView that represents the application interface<br>
 <h4>Model-View-Controller</h4><br>
View objects are visible to the user.<br>
Model objects hold data and know nothing about the user interface.<br>
Model objects typically use standard collection classes (NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet) and standard value types (NSString, NSDate, NSNumber). But there can be custom classes, which typically have names that sound like data-bearing objects, such as InsurancePolicy or PlayerHistory.<br>
View and model objects are the factory workers of an application – they focus tightly on specific tasks.
For example, an instance of UILabel (a view object) knows how to display text in a given font within a
given rectangle. An NSString instance (a model object) knows how to store a character string. But the
label doesn’t know what text it should display, and the string doesn’t know what characters it should
store.<br>
This is where controller objects come in. Controllers are the managers in an application. They keep the
view and model objects in sync, control the “flow” of the application, and save the model objects out to
the filesystem . Controllers are the least reusable classes that you will write, and they tend
to have names like ScheduleController and ScoreViewController. <br>

<h4>IBOutlet and IBAction</h4>


<br>


<p>They allow you to connect your controller and your view objects in the XIB file.<br>
A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can
work together. Your objects need connections.<br></p>

<h4>Setting pointers</h4>


<br>


<p>Notice that you drag from the object with the pointer to the object that you want that pointer to point at.
Also, notice that the pointers that appear in the connections panel are the ones that you decorated with
IBOutlet in YouNameItViewController.h.<br></p>

<h4>Setting targets and actions</h4>


<br>


<p>When a UIButton is tapped, it sends a message to another object. The object that is sent the message
is called the target. The message is called the action, and it is the name of the method that tapping the
button should trigger.<br></p>
